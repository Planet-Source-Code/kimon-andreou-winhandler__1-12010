## WinHandler


</div>

### Description

WinHandler lets you manipulate the existing windows on your system. You can resize, move, change style and text, kill, copy, paste, undo etc. All by using Win32 API calls.

It is a good demonstration (in my opinion) of Enumeration functions, SendMessage() and SetWindowPos()
 
### More Info
 
You have to have some basic understanding of how windows works, or you can really screw your system (temporarily though).

BTW, I used some parts from Randy Birch's site: www.mvps.org/vbnet

I built it have a resolution of 1024x768 pixels in mind. If you have anything less, you won't see everything.
